# SymNMF Clustering Project
This project combines C and Python, integrating them through a custom C extension module to implement a clustering algorithm based on symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (SymNMF).  

Key modules perform similarity matrix calculations, degree matrix transformations, normalized matrices, and matrix decomposition, optimized for high performance. An analysis module compares clustering results to K-means using silhouette scores to assess quality.
